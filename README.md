# forge-obsidian

Teaches AI coding assistants how to work with your Obsidian vault — wikilinks, frontmatter conventions, tag usage, and file verification. Also provides the `/Draft` and `/Promote` workflow for authoring skills in the vault before pushing them to modules.

> `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are autogenerated by `/Init` (`forge-init.sh`). Do not edit directly — run `/Update` (`forge-update.sh`) to regenerate.

## Layer

**Behaviour** — part of forge-core's three-layer architecture (Identity / Behaviour / Knowledge). Loaded at session start via `SessionStart` hook or Claude Code's native skill discovery.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ObsidianConventions` | Vault file conventions — wikilinks, frontmatter, tags, file verification |
| `VaultOperations` | TLP integration, patterns, preferences, and operational rules for vault work |
| `Draft` | Pull a module skill into the vault workspace for editing in Obsidian |
| `Promote` | Push a vault skill back to its target module for GitHub distribution |

### Draft/Promote workflow

Skills can be authored in Obsidian for iterative editing, then promoted to modules:

```
/Draft BehavioralSteering       # pull from forge-steering → vault workspace
# ... edit in Obsidian ...
/Promote BehavioralSteering     # push back to forge-steering
```

- `/Draft` copies a module skill to `Orchestration/Behaviour/<SkillName>/` and adds `source_module:` frontmatter for provenance tracking
- `/Promote` reads `source_module:`, copies back to the module, strips the provenance field, removes the vault copy, and commits
- `/Promote` (no args) promotes all drafts with `source_module:` frontmatter

The vault workspace path is configured in `forge-steering/config.yaml` under `steering:`. `forge-update.sh` auto-injects it into `plugin.json` when active drafts exist.

## Quick Start

```bash
# As a Claude Code plugin (standalone)
claude plugin install forge-obsidian

# Or as part of forge-core (submodule, already included)
git submodule update --init Modules/forge-obsidian
```

Once active, Claude Code discovers skills automatically when you work with vault files.

## Configuration

**module.yaml** — checked into git:

```yaml
name: forge-obsidian
version: 0.5.0
description: Obsidian vault conventions. USE WHEN working with Obsidian vault files.
events:
  - SessionStart
```

## User Extensions

### Inline overrides (User.md)

Create `skills/ObsidianConventions/User.md` (gitignored) with your personal rules:

```markdown
## My Overrides

- Always use ISO 8601 dates in frontmatter
- Link people with [[FirstName LastName]] format
```

## How It Works

Different AI providers load skills differently:

| Provider | How it discovers skills | How it loads content |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Reads SKILL.md frontmatter at session start | Loads full skill on demand |
| **OpenCode** | SessionStart hook emits metadata | forge-load library transforms content |
| **Cursor / Copilot** | Baked into static config via adapters | Content included at session start |

**Note for Claude Code users**: The SessionStart hook exists for non-Claude-Code providers. Claude Code's skill discovery handles content loading directly.

## Dependencies

| Module | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **forge-load** | Optional | Content loading for non-Claude-Code providers |

Degrades gracefully when absent.

## Path Resolution

Use `Core/bin/paths.sh` as the shared cross-platform path contract.

From the repository root:

```bash
eval "$(bash Core/bin/paths.sh)"
```

Then use the exported values (`FORGE_ROOT`, `FORGE_USER_ROOT`, `SAFE_READ_CMD`, `SAFE_WRITE_CMD`, memory paths, journal path, backlog path) instead of re-implementing path/env resolution inside skills.
