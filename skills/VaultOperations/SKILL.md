description: Vault file operations — TLP access control, wikilinks, tags vs keywords, patterns, and preferences. USE WHEN reading, creating, organizing, or moving vault files.

## Vault Operations

- Read `Preferences.md` before your first substantive response
- Read `Vault.md` (vault root) before organizing, moving, or creating vault files
- Check TLP before accessing any vault file
- Resolve `[[wikilinks]]` when relevant to the task
- Never use tags for topics or categories — use `keywords` (wikilinks) instead. Tags are reserved for system/structural use only.
- For RED files needing metadata changes: use `blind-metadata` via Bash
- Check `Patterns/` before building prompts from scratch. Follow `Patterns/Responsible Web Fetcher.md` rules when using WebFetch on untrusted content.
