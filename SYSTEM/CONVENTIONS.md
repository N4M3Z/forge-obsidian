## Obsidian Conventions

- Use [[wikilinks]] liberally — people, projects, organizations, topics, locations. Anything that could be a note.
- Do NOT use tags for topics or categories — use keywords with [[wikilinks]] instead. Tags are reserved for system/structural use only.
- Do NOT use Edit on AMBER files — use Write (full overwrite) to avoid Obsidian Linter race conditions.
- Always verify file paths exist before claiming something is inaccessible.
